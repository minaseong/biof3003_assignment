# HeartLens 🫀  
[Live Demo](https://biof3003-assignment-wheat.vercel.app/)

HeartLens is a web-based application that captures and processes **photoplethysmography (PPG)** signals via a webcam. It calculates **heart rate (BPM)**, **heart rate variability (HRV)**, and **signal quality** in real time using machine learning algorithms. The app also features user management, live data visualization, and automatic data storage to **MongoDB** for further analysis.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The HeartLen App is a web-based tool designed to process photoplethysmography (PPG) signals captured via a webcam. It calculates heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), and signal quality using machine learning models. The processed data can be saved to a MongoDB database for further analysis.

## 🚀 Installation Instructions

### ✅ Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB instance)

### 📦 Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heartlen-app.git
   cd heartlen-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   Add your MongoDB connection string:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open the app**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## 🔗 Connecting to MongoDB

To link the app to your MongoDB database:

1. Create a MongoDB Atlas cluster or use a local MongoDB instance.
2. Copy the connection string from MongoDB Atlas and paste it into the `.env.local` file as shown above.
3. Ensure the database has a collection named `records` to store PPG data.

## 🖥️ Usage Guide

1. **Confirm User**
   - Enter your subject name or ID
   - Click **"Confirm User"** to proceed

2. **Recording**
   - Click **"START RECORDING"** to activate the webcam
   - Allow time for signal quality to stabilize
   - Click **"START SAMPLING"** to begin saving data every 10 seconds

3. **Signal Configuration**
   - Toggle **"Show Config"** to reveal signal customization options
   - Choose your preferred signal combination setup

4. **Data Management**
   - View live plots of PPG signal, BPM, and HRV
   - Data is saved automatically or manually using **"Save Data to MongoDB"**

## 🌐 Deployment

To deploy HeartLens on a platform like Vercel:

1. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start production server locally**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Deploy on Vercel or another hosting provider**
   - Ensure `.env` variables are correctly set as "Environment Variables: in the deployment environment
